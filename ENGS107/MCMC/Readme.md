This folder contains the MCMC Chapters as part of Risk Analysis in the Earth Sciences: A Lab Manual with Exercises in R and the accompanying RScripts to replicate the examples detaied in each chapter.

MCMC is a complex concept, so we broke up the section on MCMC into three chapters. Each chapter will build off of the previous one. In this chapter, the goal is to describe how MCMC works and why it works. To do this you will code your own MCMC with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The overall goal of these three chapters are to:

1. understand the basics of MCMC
2. understand the output and what MCMC convergence means
3. how to apply and problem solve applying MCMC to a "real" model and "real" data
